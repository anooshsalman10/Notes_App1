# 📒 Notes App

A simple and clean Notes Application built with vanilla JavaScript as a foundational step toward becoming a React developer. This project focuses on practicing frontend concepts such as state management, DOM rendering, event handling, and data persistence using localStorage — all of which directly translate into modern React development.

The app allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, and automatically saves them in the browser so they persist across page reloads.
